## Critical Security Issues Status

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Input Validation for Web Scraping
**Status:** FIXED  
**Implementation:** Added comprehensive content sanitization
- HTML tags stripped from scraped content
- Script and style content removed
- Dangerous characters escaped
- Control characters filtered
- Content length limited

### üü° PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Hardcoded Credentials
**Status:** IMPROVED  
**Implementation:** Environment variable fallbacks removed for critical settings
- Removed hardcoded default email addresses
- SMTP configuration still has fallback defaults
- **Remaining Risk:** Default SMTP settings may not be secure for all users

## High Priority Issues Status

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Error Logging Security
**Status:** FIXED  
**Implementation:** Secure error message sanitization
- URLs replaced with [URL] placeholder
- Email addresses replaced with [EMAIL] placeholder  
- IP addresses replaced with [IP] placeholder
- API keys redacted as [REDACTED]
- Error message length limited to 200 characters

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Rate Limiting for External API Calls  
**Status:** FIXED  
**Implementation:** Comprehensive rate limiting system
- OpenAI API: 10 requests per hour
- HTTP requests: 50 requests per hour
- Email sending: 25 emails per day
- Automatic reset after time windows
- Graceful degradation when limits exceeded

### üü° IMPROVED: Local Storage Security
**Status:** IMPROVED  
**Implementation:** Sensitive data filtering in logs
- Email addresses partially masked in logs (e.g., ri***@domain.com)
- Error messages sanitized before logging
- **Remaining Risk:** Log files still stored unencrypted

## Medium Priority Issues Status

### üî¥ NOT ADDRESSED: HTTPS Verification
**Status:** PENDING  
**Risk:** Man-in-the-middle attacks during web scraping
**Recommendation:** Implement certificate pinning for FMT website

### üî¥ NOT ADDRESSED: Process Management Security  
**Status:** PENDING  
**Risk:** PID file vulnerabilities and race conditions
**Recommendation:** Implement secure process management

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Email Content Sanitization
**Status:** FIXED  
**Implementation:** HTML content sanitization before email sending
- All user content sanitized through comprehensive filters
- Email formatting uses trusted templates only

### üü° IMPROVED: Dependency Security
**Status:** IMPROVED  
**Implementation:** Added .gitignore for sensitive files
- **Remaining Risk:** No automated dependency vulnerability scanning

## Current Security Posture

### ‚úÖ SAFE FOR DEPLOYMENT
The system is now **significantly more secure** and suitable for:
- Personal use with proper environment variable configuration
- Educational purposes and demonstrations
- Small-scale production deployments with monitoring

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS
For enterprise or high-security deployments, address:
1. HTTPS certificate verification for web scraping
2. Log file encryption and rotation
3. Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
4. Enhanced process management security

## Configuration Security Checklist

Before deployment, ensure:
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` set via environment variable
- [ ] `SMTP_PASSWORD` set via environment variable  
- [ ] `EMAIL_USER` set via environment variable
- [ ] `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` set via environment variable
- [ ] No credentials in source code
- [ ] `.gitignore` configured to exclude log files
- [ ] Rate limiting settings appropriate for your use case
- [ ] SMTP settings configured for your email provider

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Monitor rate limit violations** in logs
2. **Check for sanitization warnings** in error messages
3. **Review email delivery success rates** for anomalies
4. **Audit log files regularly** for security issues
5. **Keep dependencies updated** with security patches

The system now implements industry-standard security practices and is ready for responsible deployment.
